### What is this? 
This is a reference enviroment for our particle dosimetry work. It has a standard set of scripts to set things up, get code, and run the code and produce output used in the paper.  

### What do I need to use it?
You will need three free, small, commonly used tools to use build and use this reference environment.
You will need a copy of vagrant, available here: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
You will need a copy of git, available here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
You will need virtualbox, available here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

### How do I use it?

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/reference_environment_template.git
$ cd reference_environment_template
$ vagrant up
```
This will build a virtual environment and run through each of the scripts with examples
of use.
