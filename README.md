### What is this? 
This is a template for a reference environment.  It has a standard set of scripts to install packages, get code and set things up.  

### How do I use it?

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/reference_environment_template.git
$ cd reference_environment_template
$ vagrant up
```
This will build a virtual environment and run through each of the scripts with examples
of use.
